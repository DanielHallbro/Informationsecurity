# Information Security Analysis & Maturity Assessment

This repository contains an information security analysis conducted for the fictional organization **PillMedTech**. The project focuses on assessing organizational security maturity using the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency's (**MSB**) "Mognadsdialog" framework.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary goal was to evaluate the current state of information security at PillMedTech, identify gaps in their systematic work, and present a strategic roadmap to the board of directors to elevate their maturity from **Level 1 (Reactive)** towards **Level 3 (Systematic)**.



## 🛠 Frameworks & Methodology
* **MSB Mognadsdialog:** Utilized to assess six key perspectives of information security: Culture, Working Methods, Application, Results, Follow-up, and Improvement.
* **PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act):** Applied as the core framework for continuous improvement and systematic information security management.
* **Gap Analysis:** Identified the transition needed from ad-hoc, person-dependent processes to unified, documented routines.

## 📊 Key Findings
The assessment revealed several critical areas for improvement:
* **Systematic Management:** Transitioning from "knowing but not doing" to a structured approach with clear roles and responsibilities.
* **Risk Management:** Moving from reactive incident handling to proactive risk assessment and measurable results.
* **Organizational Impact:** Highlighting that information security is a long-term investment in trust and competitive advantage rather than a mere cost.



## 🚀 Recommended Roadmap
1. **Establish Leadership Support:** Securing commitment from the board is the primary driver for a successful security culture.
2. **Define Roles & Responsibilities:** Clarifying who is accountable for specific security routines to ensure they are followed.
3. **Continuous Improvement:** Implementing a step-by-step plan to meet regulatory requirements and increase organizational resilience.
